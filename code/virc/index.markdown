Virc is an IRC client in Vim. Or more accuratly, it's a Vim wrapper around
[ii][ii].

Things Virc will do for you:

- Start `ii` automatically for you.
- Setup a tab for every channel/PM you're in with 2 windows (one for incoming,
  one for typing new messages).


Usage
-----
1. Make sure you have [ii][ii] and [auto\_autoread][read] installed.
1. Start with `./virc`.

Note this is all rather *experimental*, so don't expect anything polished quite
yet...
