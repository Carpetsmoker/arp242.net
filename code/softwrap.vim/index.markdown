Unobtrusively highlight column 81 to indicate that we may have to wrap stuff âˆ’
this is a "soft wrap".

Column 121 is highlighted a bit more obvious, as this is really getting too
long!

This is a less obtrusive way of doing "set colorcolumn" (which is just
distracting and annoying).

Configuring
-----------
This plugin is extremely simple; almost trivially so. Code for configuration
would be more than the actual plugin code.

Simply copy the contents of `plugin/softwrap.vim` to your vimrc or fork this
repo.
