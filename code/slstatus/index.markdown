This is my configuration of [`slstatus`](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/).
I did not write most of this, this is simply a convenience repository to track
my configuration and patches.

Also see the
[original README](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/slstatus/blob/master/README).

It it up-to-date with upstream commit
[`47d0073`](https://git.suckless.org/slstatus/log/) (2017-12-03), which is the
most recent version as of December 2017. I will try to keep things up to date;
feel free to open an issue if it's not.

TODO: stop updating if bar is hidden.
