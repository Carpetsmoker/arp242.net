What do you get when you search for ‘Firefox’ in a new Windows 10 installation?

A big fat ad for Microsoft Edge:

<div class="center-img"><img alt="Firefox in Bing" src="{% base64 ./_images/browser/ms-edge1.png %}"></div>

Note that this is a *full-screen* screenshot on a 1920x1080 screen (right-click
and select ‘view image’ for the full size). Firefox is juts *barely* visible at
the bottom.

But it doesn’t end there, Microsoft also “helpfully” displays a warning that
this file “could harm your computer”:

<div class="center-img"><img alt="Downloading Firefox" src="{% base64 ./_images/browser/ms-edge2.png %}"></div>

[According to
Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2566263/a-warning-message-unexpectedly-appears-when-you-try-to-download-a-file),
“The SmartScreen Application Reputation service checks the reputation of a
file”, and should display this only for files with no significant reputation.
Somehow I find it hard to believe that the Firefox installer fits this bill…

But wait, there’s more! When changing the default browser from Edge to Firefox
we get yet another ad, baked right in to the settings screen:

<div class="center-img"><img alt="Changing default browser" src="{% base64 ./_images/browser/ms-edge3.png %}"></div>

It doesn’t end with Microsoft. For years Google displayed a Chrome
advertisements on Google search (although it seems they have stopped doing it
now). And what about enabling the ‘Do Not Track’ header in Chrome?

<div class="center-img"><img alt="Enabling Do Not Track" src="{% base64 ./_images/browser/chrome1.png %}"></div>

I’m sure that the fact that Google has a significant vested interest in tracking
the hell out of everyone on the internet is purely coincidental.

These concerns are hardly new of course. The Microsoft browser bundling was a
subject of much complaining and litigation in the past leading to the (in)famous
[BrowserChoice.eu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserChoice.eu). Whether that
was a good decision or not is up for grabs, but baking full-page ads and
warnings in your products strikes me as ethically dubious at best.

I haven’t used Windows – or any Microsoft product – in years, but it looks like
it’s still the same old crap. Just booting Windows also completely blew away my
`grub` bootloader by the way. My ten-minute stint with Microsoft Windows is
over.

All of this makes paying the Microsoft tax on my ThinkPad even more sour…
