title: "Being right"
---

After almost 400 years it turned out that [*Fermat's last theorem*][1] was
correct. However, the [proof discovered by Andrew Wiles][2] is a highly complex
piece of modern mathematics, and almost certainly not what Fermat had in mind.

Did Fermat have another proof? Perhaps. But close to 400 years of searching
hasn't revealed any hints of it, and at this point it seems highly likely that
Fermat was mistaken in his reasoning, but happened to be accidentally correct in
his conclusion.

This leaves us with the question whether Fermat was was *right* or *wrong*. Are
you still *right* when your conclusion is correct, but the reasoning that led
you to arrive at the conclusion is flawed, or – even worse – you had simply
guessed the correct conclusion?

I don't think you are. Not outside of pub quizzes, anyway (everything is fair if
free beer is at stake). Conclusions *can* be useful on their own in some –
usually simple – cases, like which direction is the quickest. In almost all more
complex arguments the reasoning is just as important, if not more important.

If I come to the conclusion that global warming is real because there
isn't enough classroom prayer then my *conclusion* is correct, but any attempts
at actually solving this problem will be a waste of time and effort, as my
reasoning is completely wrong. Just having the correct conclusion is often
useless.

There are many examples where people might have a correct *conclusion*, but
completely counter-productive reasoning:

- Declassification of the [Verona
  project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project) in 1995 revealed that
  USSR spies has infiltrated the U.S. and U.K. governments, leading some to the
  conclusion that Joseph McCarthy's frantic anti-Communist witch hunts were
  justified.  
  McCarthy had no knowledge of *actual* USSR spies, and there is zero overlap
  between actual spies identified by the Venona project and people identified by
  McCarthy.

- Alex Jones’ famous [THEY’RE TURNING THE FROGS
  GAY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ePLkAm8i2s) fragment is correct in its
  conclusion as chemicals *are* causing sexual changes in frogs and other
  animals. <sup>(ref: [1](http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/),
  [2](http://www.newsweek.com/female-frogs-estrogen-hermaphrodites-suburban-waste-369553),
  [3](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0301_040301_genderbender.html))</sup>
  Jones completely misidentifies the reason for this as ‘social engineering’
  rather than urban and industrial waste (which is why he is crazy).

(.. and many more; I'll add examples as I find them ..)
