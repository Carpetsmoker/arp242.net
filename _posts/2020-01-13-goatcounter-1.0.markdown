I just tagged GoatCounter 1.0! A lot of things have changed since the [initial
announcement](/goatcounter.html), a whole bunch of new features have been added,
it's a lot faster, and many minor details have been improved. Thanks to everyone
who provided feedback!

There's still a lot of work to be done, and I aim to release a new version
roughly every 6 to 8 weeks. The next version will mostly focus on small UX
improvements and making the self-hosting experience better. You can see the
[roadmap for 1.1 on GitHub][1.1].

The roadmap for 1.2 and beyond is less well-defined, but in general I'd like to
work on improving the data quality in 1.2/1.3, and improving the data
visualisation in 1.4 and beyond.

I'm also going to be spending a bit more time on promoting GoatCounter. You can
have the best product in the world, but if no one has heard of it then, well,
it's kind of pointless.

I'll also start maintaining a [devlog](/devlog.html), which I'll try to update
weekly. It has a separate [RSS feed](/devlog.xml).
