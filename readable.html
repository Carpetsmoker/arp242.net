<p>
I don't know what's up with people; for some reason they don’t want their web pages to be readable.
See <a href="/weblog/reader-mode-is-ridiculous.html">‘Reader mode’ in web browsers is ridiculous</a>.</p>

<p>This little bookmarklet should reset the font to something sane for most websites. Hopefully. It’s a lightweight
alternative to Reader mode and such.</p>

<p>Drag the below link to the bookmarks bar. If you don't have one add the contents of it to your bookmarks
some other way (I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out how).</p>

<p>
	<a href="javascript:(function() {
		document.querySelectorAll('p, li, div').forEach(function(n) {
			n.style.color = '#000';
			n.style.font = '500 16px/1.7em sans-serif';
		})
	})();">Readable!</a>
</p>
