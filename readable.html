<p>
I don't know what's up with people. <a
	href="ttps://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/blog/2013/03/06/announcing-sodium-a-new-cryptographic-library/">Look at
	this</a>. Thin light-grey text on a white background. Completely unreadable.</p>

<p>This little bookmarklet should reset it for most websites. Hopefully.</p>

<p>Drag the below link to the bookmarks bar. If you don't have one add the contents of it to your bookmarks
some other way (I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out how).</p>

<p>
	<a href="javascript:(function() {
		document.querySelectorAll('p, li, div').forEach(function(n) {
			n.style.color = '#000'
			n.style.font = '500 16px/1.7em sans-serif'
		})
	})();">Readable!</a>
</p>
