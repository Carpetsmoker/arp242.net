  The 2017 "third season". I'm ... not quite sure what to think. I disliked the
  slow pacing (take Dougie to a hospital already, he's clearly NOT fine!) and
  quite frankly I didn't quite understand quite a lot of it. I'm all for complex
  films, but not a fan of deciphering films like a puzzle.

  Perhaps I'll like it more on a rewatch.

  While the setting can seem stuffy and outdated, the dialogue is surprisingly
  witty and on-point.

  Continues in *Yes, Prime Minister*, which is essentially the same series.

- Scarface film okay

  Bit boring. It was a massive "scandal" due to its "violent content" when it
  was released, which says more about 1932 United States than the film.

  A ridiculous ego project from William Shatner to make sure the world knows how
  brilliant he is. If you like Star Trek then you should probably watch this,
  preferably with a beer or 4 and several of your Trekkie buddies, as the
  results are (unintentionally) hilarious.
