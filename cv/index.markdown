Martin Tournoij
===============

<!--I am currently (February 2019) looking for a new challenging position to help
build a neat project. -->
I have experience with a wide variety of tools and languages. My favourites are
**Go** and **Python**. I have also written programs in PHP, Ruby, Tcl,
JavaScript, C, Perl, Scheme, Haskell, and Lua.

<!-- I am a Dutch citizen, currently living in New Zealand and working remote.
I'm willing to consider relocating to more or less any location for the right
position. -->

My first programming experience was when I was 13 and wanted to sort my
collection of MSX games alphabetically. I don't know which algorithm I used − it
wasn't very fast − but it worked.
Since then I like to write software to solve problems and make life easier. When
writing code I try to avoid verbosity and strive for conciseness. Simple is
usually better − although there are exceptions.

My work attitude is to "think like an owner"; that is, to think about what is
the best for the product and company and take ownership / responsibility for
aspects where I think it will benefit the product.
I place a high value on emotional intelligence, positivity, and empathic
communication.
