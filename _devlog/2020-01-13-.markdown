Haven't done too much in the last week as I was on a short holiday to [Gili
Air][air], which is a very nice island will probably be back (it's fairly close
to where I live). I wanted to release 1.0 on Jan 5th, but felt rather sick that
day, and didn't want to release/announce it just the day before going away
either.

Last week was pretty active though, with many updates to GoatCounter: the
`-debug` flag makes printing debug logs easier, the rate limiter is a lot
better, and many minor bugfixes. Probably the biggest user-visible change is
that I replaced `input type="data"` with a JS datepicker on all non-mobile
platforms. The HTML 5 input doesn't work on Safari, looks real ugly in Firefox,
and styling the input in a cross-platform manner is really tricky for some
reason. Replacing it with JS is just easier for now.

The GoatCounter.com hosting is now more resilient since requests to `/count`
will be "buffered" and retried with [httpbuf][httpbuf] if the main goatcounter
process is unavailable. I originally created this for the ~5 minutes of downtime
required for a PostgreSQL upgrade, but it's also useful to protect against
general downtime. Also see the [Varnish VCL][vcl].

I also created [border][border], a small commandline tool to add a border around
PNG images, fixed a [file descriptor leak in `reload`][reload] (funny how long
these bugs can go unnoticed), and fixed a few small syntax highlighting issues
in [gopher.vim][gopher].
