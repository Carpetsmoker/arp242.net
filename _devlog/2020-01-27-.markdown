Quietly churning along with a bunch of new features: the [site code is a lot
simpler][122], you can [ignore your own views][128], [link to the page in the
overview][138], configure [data retention][134] and the [thousands
separator][132]. Also fixed various smaller issues, and Lukas Murdock
[contributed a logo][139], so it looks all professional and stuff :-)

The most exciting update is that GoatCounter will be funded by the [NGI Zero PET
fund][pet]. This has been in the works for a while, but things are close to
being finalized. This will give me €25,000 so I won't have to worry too much
about the financials for a while, and can just focus on building a great service
(rather than spending time marketing it).

I'll write a more detailed overview about the financials later, although it's
mostly fairly uninteresting: I currently get about €70/month in total from
subscription and Patreon, hosting costs are about €30/month, and I spent about 6
months working on this full-time, so I invested about €30k of my own money.
