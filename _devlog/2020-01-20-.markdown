Been a busy week; the announcements on Lobsters and HN were received quite well,
with loads of feedback and reports. I was a bit worried about this after my
[first announcement][hn] on HN was mostly ignored back in August ðŸ˜… The HN
gamble is such a fun game.

The biggest visible change this week is that you can now [filter pages][filter].
It only affects the page list (and not the browser/size/location stats) at the
bottom, as they're stored in a way that makes it impossible to adjust right now.
I'm not sure if that's a huge problem.

Most of the other changes have been fairly small bug fixes or improvements, most
of them prompted by feedback (chat, email. GitHub, HN thread). Nothing
especially spectacular.

The [site code could be a lot better][code]; there is no reason to build the
`<script>` tag dynamically; can just use `<script src="..">` with some tricks.
The patch should be ready, just want to test it a bit more (unfortunately I
haven't been able to find a JavaScript testing solution that I like, so no
automated tests ðŸ˜ž).
