title: Desk reader view

<p>
	A "bookmarklet" for Desk reader view. This will:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>open all collapsed messages;</li>
	<li>reverse the order so that it's chronological (oldest first).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This is much more convenient than the default view if you want to "read" a long ticket to follow a discussion. This
	feature will <em>probably</em> be added to Desk at some point in the future, but if you can't wait you can use it
	<em>right now!</em>
</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>Drag the below link to the bookmarks bar. If you don't have one add the contents of it to your bookmarks
some other way I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out how).</p>

<p>
	<a href="javascript:(function() {
		$('.reply--box.reply-open.reply-collapse .reply-trigger').trigger('click');

		var component = app.ko.contextFor($('#ticket-view-tab-messages')[0]).$component;
		component.ticket.threads(component.ticket.threads().reverse());

		/* Reloading ticket resets the order */
		component.FetchTicket = function() { }
	})();">Desk reader view</a>
</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
	This is a hack. It will disable updating of tickets, and may have unpredictable side-effects if you try to modify
	stuff. You should probably modify stuff in a different tab or something and use this <em>only</em> for reading
	tickets.
</p>
