title: Send to WhatsApp
---

<p>You can send messages to people on WhatsApp by using a special "API" link; this way you don't
have to add them as contacts in your phone:
<code>https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=[..]</code>.
You can also use api.whatsapp.com for the desktop/phone app.</p>

<form method="get" action="https://web.whatsapp.com/send">
	<strong>Web</strong>
	<input type="text" name="phone">
	<button>Go</button>
</form>

<form method="get" action="https://api.whatsapp.com/send">
	<strong>API</strong>
	<input type="text" name="phone">
	<button>Go</button>
</form>
