Some stuff I "rated". I keep a list here for my own purposes ("did I watch this
before? Did I like it? What film shall we watch this evening?") and also to
maybe lead people to interesting content.

I have a simple rating system:

- meh    – Didn't like it.
- okay   – It was okay, I guess. Not bad, not great.
- good   – I enjoyed it!
- great  – This is really good stuff!
- lol    – What kind of rating do you assign to *Plan 9 from Outer Space?* I
		   assign it a "lol" rating. It's neither good nor bad, it's just lol.
		   These films are best watched in combination with beer and/or friends.

I think this is much more useful than numbers or assigning "stars".

I don't extensively review stuff but do add the occasional notes. Should be
mostly spoiler-free, in case you care about that sort of thing.

| American Beauty | great |  |  |
| Black Mirror | great | scifi |  |
| [Detectorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detectorists) | great | british, drama, comedy | This series is great. Quiet and gentle. |
| Extras | great | comedy, british |  |
| Fawlty Towers | great | comedy, british | "Don't mention the war!" |
| Final Space | great | anim, comedy, scifi |  |
| That Mitchell and Webb Look | great | british, comedy |  |
| The Office (U.K.) | great | comedy, british |  |
| [The Thick of It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thick_of_It) | great | british, politics | Profanity and threats of violence have never been funnier. |
| [The Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire) | great |  |  |
| Twin Peaks | great |  |  |
| [Yes Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister) <sup>(1980-1988)</sup> | great | british, comedy, politics | While the setting can seem stuffy and outdated, the dialogue is surprisingly witty and on-point.<br> Continues in *Yes, Prime Minister*, which is essentially the same series. |
| BoJack Horseman | good |  |  |
| Brooklyn Nine-Nine | good | comedy, police | Not a huge fan of American sit-coms, but this one is really good. |
| Death Note | good | anim |  |
| Rick and Morty | good | anim, scifi |  |
| The IT Crowd | good | comedy |  |
| Making a Murderer | okay | docu |  |
| Sense8 | okay |  | Had good moments. Also many boring ones, and the "grand finale" was pretty bad (as they often are). |
| Twin Peaks: the Return | okay |  | The 2017 "third season". I'm ... not quite sure what to think. I disliked the slow pacing (take Dougie to a hospital already, he's clearly NOT fine!) and quite frankly I didn't quite understand quite a lot of it. I'm all for complex films, but not a fan of deciphering films like a puzzle.<br> Perhaps I'll like it more on a rewatch. |
| Peep Show | meh | british, comedy | As much as I love Mitchell and Webb, I found this just ... awkward? |
| [Star Trek Beyond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Beyond) | meh | scifi | Only watched the first season, but good heavens is it silly. Everything that made Star Trek good has been replaced by everything that makes science fiction silly. |

Games

{:class="full"}
| Title | Rating | Tags | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| Alan Wake | great |  |  |
| Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura | great |  |  |
| Baldur's Gate | great |  | *"Get my out of this hell hole!"* |
| Baldur's Gate II | great |  | Lacks the true depth of some other RPGs, but it makes up for it by being more fun in many other areas.<br> *"You must gather your party before venturing forth"* |
| Deponia series | great |  | The first three games were really good. I liked the fourth one less. |
| Fallout 2 | great |  | Improves on the original in every way. |
| Grim Fandango | great |  |  |
| Hotline Miami | great |  |  |
| I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream | great |  | Professional curmudgeon Harlan Ellison does a game based on several of his stories. If you liked Ellison's writing then you'll like this. Not your average point-and-click; much of the game is quite disturbing. |
| Jagged Alliance 2 | great |  | Still the best game in its genre. |
| Monkey Island series | great |  | Classic point-and-click adventures. Get me some grog! |
| Pillars of Eternity | great |  | What do you get if you mix the fun of *Baldurs's Gate 2* and the writing of *Planescape: Torement*? Probably something very similar to *Pillars of Eternity*. |
| Planescape: Torment | great | rpg | Rightfully considered one of the best RPGs of its time, and I think it holds up very well by modern standards. |
| S2: Silent Storm | great |  | Almost as good as JA2 |
| Shovel Knight | great |  | Mega-man, but with a shovel. |
| The Dig | great |  | Not as light-hearted as some of the other LucalArts point-and-click adventures, but you get a pretty neat sci-fi story in return. It's a good trade-off. |
| Thief 2 | great |  |  |
| Tyranny | great |  | Great RPG with some good writing. I was slightly disappointed with the story progression; in the start you feel like a regular soldier part of a big war in which you don't have much control. Unfortunately it progresses to the more standard "you're the centre of the universe" model like so many RPGs a bit later on.<br> Still a great game though. |
| Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines | great | rpg | Great story-driven FPS/RPG. |
| Wadjet Eye Games | great |  | All point-and-click adventures from Wadjet Eye are really good, although some are a bit short (especially the earlier ones).<br> *Blackwell*, *Shardlight*, *Gemini Rue*, *Primordia*, *The Shivah*, *A Golden Wake*, *Technobabylon*, *Unavowed*, *Resonance*. |
| *Hollow Knight* | good |  | Fun side-scrolling and exploring. |
| 10tons top-down shooters | good |  | All these games (*Crimsonland*, *Tesla vs. Lovecraft*, *Neon Chrome*) are essentially the same game, although many details differ.<br> All are good shooters, and remain fun for a quick game longer than many others. |
| Age of Wonders | good |  |  |
| Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic | good |  | Probably the best Age of Wonders game? |
| [Beneath a Steel Sky](https://www.gog.com/game/beneath_a_steel_sky) | good |  | Surprisingly good, especially considering it's free. |
| Brigador: Up-Armored Edition | good |  | Walk around in a mech, shoot stuff. Pretty fun, but levels are rather long and gets a bit repetitive. |
| Brutal Legend | good |  | It's a bit silly, but good fun.<br> Major annoyance: the music stops playing in far too many cases! Since there is some sort of interaction every minute or two it means it won't finish many songs! |
| Build engine games | good | fps | Classic Build Engine shooters *Duke Nukem 3D*, *Shadow Warrior*, and *Blood*. I played them as a child in the 90s, but then mostly forgot until last year. All three are similar enough to review in one go.<br> The good: fun shooter without taking itself too serious.<br> Not so good: walking through a level 6 times because you missed a button somewhere. |
| Desktop Dungeons | good |  | Pretty fun puzzle RPG. Takes a bit too much time/effort to progress past a certain level for my liking though. |
| Dex | good |  | Side-scrolling action RPG. Works pretty well. |
| Expeditions: Conquistador | good |  |  |
| FTL: Faster Than Light | good |  |  |
| Fallout | good |  |  |
| Gone Home | good |  |  |
| Guacamelee! | good |  |  |
| Hotline Miami 2 | good |  |  |
| Icewind Dale | good |  | Lacks the extensive story and non-linearity of some of the other Infinity Engine games (BG, PST), but still pretty good. I felt the visuals and general atmosphere was better done than Baldur's Gate 2. |
| Nox | good |  |  |
| [Prince of Persia](https://www.gog.com/game/prince_of_persia) | good |  | 2008 version. |
| Prison Architect | good |  |  |
| Rogue Legacy | good |  |  |
| Slain: Back from Hell | good |  |  |
| Stasis | good |  | Point and click horror adventure. |
| SteamWorld Dig 1 & 2 | good |  | The first Steamworld Dig was short and fun. The second was longer and better in most ways. |
| System Shock 2 | good |  |  |
| Theme Hospital | good |  |  |
| Thief | good |  |  |
| Unepic | good |  |  |
| Victor Vran | good |  | Fun action RPG which doesn't take itself too serious. A better version of *Diablo*. |
| War for the Overworld | good |  | Dungeon Keeper, but better. |
| Wasteland 2 | good |  |  |
| Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within | lol |  | Playing this game is like watching *The Room*. |
| Braid | okay |  | It's okay, but tedious. |
| Door Kickers | okay |  |  |
| [Door Kickers: Action Squad](https://www.gog.com/game/door_kickers_action_squad) | okay |  | Fun shooter for a little bit. Gets a bit boring quite fast. |
| Enter the Gungeon | okay |  | Not sure how to rate this one. On one hand, it's pretty good fun. On the other hand, progressing is really hard and time-consuming. Certainly much more time-consuming than I'm willing to put in to an action game. |
| Fallout tactics | okay |  |  |
| Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers | okay |  |  |
| Hard West | okay |  |  |
| Kingpin: life of crime | okay |  |  |
| Luftrausers | okay |  |  |
| [Mana Spark](https://www.gog.com/game/mana_spark) | okay |  | Walk around, kill monsters, die, repeat. |
| Shadowrun | okay |  | *Shadowrun returns*, *Shadowrun: Dragonfall*, and *Shadowrun Hong Kong*. They're all ... okay. I dislike the "play level, talk to all characters, play level, talk to characters"-cycle. |
| Soldak RPGs | okay |  | All these games (*Din's Curse*, *Drox Operative*, *Depths of Peril*) are essentially the same. It's a little fun for a bit, then it gets repetitive. |
| SteamWorld Heist | okay |  | Tactical shooter. It's okay, but not too hard and fairly repetitive. |
| Stronghold HD, Stronghold Crusader HD | okay |  | I like the idea, but the enemy AI is too stupid and it gets repetitive. |
| Surgeon Simulator 2013 | okay |  | Fun for a bit. |
| World of Goo | okay |  |  |
| A Bird Story | meh |  |  |
| Alien Rampage | meh |  |  |
| Alien Shooter | meh |  |  |
| Another World | meh |  | I know it's supposed to be a "classic", but I mostly thought it's just tedious. |
| Barony | meh |  |  |
| BloodNet | meh |  | Seems pretty cool in theory, but controls and interface is confusing and tedious, and takes the fun out of it. |
| Costume Quest | meh |  |  |
| Crusader: No Remorse and No Regret | meh |  | I have fond memories of these games, and was excited to see them on GoG. Unfortunately they have not aged well at all. The controls in particular and annoying and tedious. |
| Don't Starve | meh |  | I wanted to like this so much, and I tried. But it's just too tedious and I need to spend far too much time in it to progress. |
| Driftmoon | meh |  | Really boring RPG. |
| Duke Nukem 1 & 2 | meh |  | Not particularly great side-scrolling shooters. |
| Halcyon 6: Starbase Commander | meh |  |  |
| Halfway | meh |  | Pretty repetitive. |
| Human Resource Machine | meh |  |  |
| Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis | meh |  | I tried a few times, but could never  get in to this LucasArt adventure. |
| Little Big Adventure | meh |  | Tried both the first and second ones. Didn't like either much. |
| Megabyte Punch | meh |  |  |
| Pray for Death | meh |  | Horrible controls. |
| Reigns | meh |  | Gets very boring very fast. |
| S.T.A.L.K.E.R. | meh |  | The camera moves so much during walking that it made me dizzy. There is no way to disable it so 🤷 |
| Serpent in the Staglands | meh |  | Lack of story development and high difficulty just made this tedious and boring. |
| Syndicate | meh |  | I loved this game when I was younger, but feel it hasn't aged well. The UI is just clunky. |
| Teenagent | meh |  |  |
| The Final Station | meh |  |  |
| To The Moon | meh |  | Terrible pacing with mediocre writing |
| Torchlight | meh |  | Another boring RPG. |
| Transistor | meh |  |  |
| Two Worlds Epic Edition | meh |  |  |
| Volgarr the Viking | meh |  | This game is profoundly stupid. The controls are bad and feel clunky, and the developers seem to have confused difficulty with providing a fun playing experience.<br> Genuinely one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of paying for, and I would ask my money back if I could. |
| Wasteland 1 | meh |  | Has not aged well. |
| else Heart.Break() | meh |  |  |
