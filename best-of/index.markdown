The World Wide Web is brilliant, but to get at anything interesting you’ll have to dig through a humongous pile
of shit to get at it.

This is an ever-changing list of some of the best content on the web that I’ve encountered. The programming stuff is its
own category, as that’t a fairly narrow and specific interest. Most of the other things are of general interest.

This list is ever-changing/growing as I’m (slowly) organizing my huge bookmarks list collected over eights years. New
links are also added as I encounter them.

The list is in no particular order. Items with a <sup>▸</sup> are a video.

- [God's Lonely Programmer](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gods-lonely-programmer) – about Terry Davis,
  creator of [TempleOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS).
- [How electroshock therapy changed me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEZrAGdZ1i8) <sup>▸</sup> – perhaps not so much about
  electroshock therapy, but more about it’s never too late to take control of your life and move it in the direction you
  want.
- [Open-mindedness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T69TOuqaqXI) <sup>▸</sup>
- [Angel'in Heavy Syrup – First Love ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3pckDDx77s) <sup>▸</sup> – by far the best band
  you’ve (probably) never heard of.
- [Once Upon a Time in Norway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX7QTv_Zvpo) <sup>▸</sup> – the strange Norwegian Black Metal
  culture of the earlier 90s. Interesting even if you don’t care about the music (mostly about group dynamics).
- [On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs](https://web.archive.org/web/20150204152746/http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) –
  Everything that’s wrong with the modern economy?
- [The golden quarter](https://aeon.co/essays/has-progress-in-science-and-technology-come-to-a-halt) – some of our
  greatest cultural and technological achievements took place between 1945 and 1971. Why has progress stalled?
- [Why elections are bad for
  democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/why-elections-are-bad-for-democracy) – lots of people seem
  to equate ‘elections’ with ‘democracy’, but they’re not the same things!
- [Before you can be with others, first learn to be alone](https://aeon.co/ideas/before-you-can-be-with-others-first-learn-to-be-alone)
- [What Bullets Do to Bodies](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gun-violence/)
- [History of the Amiga](https://arstechnica.com/series/history-of-the-amiga/)


Programming
===========
- [The Mess We're In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) <sup>▸</sup> – Erlang creator Joe Armstrong about the
  state of software today.
- [Simplicity is Complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM) <sup>▸</sup> 
- [Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?](http://bikeshed.com/) – applies to all of life, really.
- [The Art of Unix Programming](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/) (book) – this should have been named ‘The Art
  of Programming’, full stop. Useful for any programmer.
- [Scaling Mercurial at Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook) – an
  interesting case study how a ‘slower’ language can actually be faster on account of being easier to work with.
- [The Website Obesity Crisis](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) – we really don’t need 4MB pages and
  Amazon EC2 and whatnot to show people a news article or weblog post.
- [Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale](https://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/)
- [How the Web Became Unreadable](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/how-the-web-became-unreadable/) – the amount of time I
  spend frobbing in my browser’s inspector to make shit readable is getting ridiculous.
